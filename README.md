A django framework intended for various videogames involving trading/market dynamics. 

This is primarily designed for videogames (e.g., X3, Pioneer, OSRS, etc.) that don't have built-in tracking of trades over time, built to give an easier interface for storing trading history versus local or cloud based spreadsheets (e.g., G-Sheets, Excel, LibreOffice, etc.) that doesn't result in clutter.

Currently a WIP focused on the backend, but moving forward will incorporate visualizations and a healthier frontend (most likely using react) to better show profitability.
